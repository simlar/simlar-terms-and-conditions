Simlar stands for the best possible protection of your communication. Of course, this also applies to protect your data. Only the most necessary information for the full functionality of the app is stored. This is also only done for the required duration. The communication with the Simlar servers is always encrypted and therefore protected against unauthorized access.
This privacy policy summarizes the points concerning your information.

1. Your encrypted calls
Simlar guarantees the best possible encryption of voice and video calls with the app. This is a tap-proof and encrypted system according to the current technical standard and to our knowledge.
Simlar uses end to end encryption. Even the Simlar servers do not have access to call content. The operators of the Simlar app have no possibility to decrypt the conversations of the app users or to track the content. Only the caller and the callee can decrypt the call.
Data required for setting up the call is transmitted encrypted to the Simlar servers. For technical reasons (e.g. for error analysis) this data could also be temporarily stored on the servers.

2. Your telephone number
For the full functionality of the app the user's phone number is required. The assigned Simlar ID is linked to the telephone number.
This is needed to find known contacts.
The telephone number used for the link is only stored for the purpose of contact list synchronization and the functionality of the app. It is also not misused or used for advertising purposes.

3. Data access of the app
The following data is required for the functionality of the app:

a) Contact list (optional)
If you grant the Simlar app access to your contact list, only the phone numbers, no names or other data is send to the server to find other users. Simlar does not store the phone numbers of your contacts on the server.

b) Version number
The app transmits its version name and version number to the servers in order to better trace possible problems.

c) Push notification ID (optional)
The Push Notification ID is needed e.g. to notify the app about an incoming call. For this purpose, the Simlar server transfers it to the respective push provider. This saves energy on your smartphone.
Under Android the app can alternatively be operated with a permanent connection to the Simlar server. Then no data is transmitted to Google.

4. Third party
Third party services (Apple, Google and Twilio) are used exclusively for sending push notifications and SMS messages. Their privacy policies apply.
Data will only be passed on to third parties to ensure the functionality of the App and never for other purposes (e.g. advertising).

5. Log data
Log data is stored on the server for a maximum of 14 days, and this is only to facilitate troubleshooting, optimize the service and prevent misuse.

6. Cooperation clause and crash notification
In case of crashes or problems, there is the possibility within the app to voluntarily and explicitly agree to report a crash notification. In addition to the reason for the system error, personal data may also be transmitted (E.g. the current state of the app at the time of the crash and the last log messages).
The transmission to the Simlar servers is encrypted. This voluntary support allows you to help us improve.

7. General regulations
In any case the provisions of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the current law and regulations of the Federal Republic of Germany apply - http://dejure.org/gesetze/BDSG
